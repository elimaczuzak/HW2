Calendar app for CS 407

Because a strict calenar view was not required (and not available in the standard library), I opted to make a list view for the events.
 All functionality is there for the requirements, although for whatever reason, the events do not appear under ViewEvents. I tried 
 debugging this for hours, and couldn't figure it out. I do have the code to actually REMOVE the events in place, so if I could get
 them to display, the functionality to remove them would be there.
